# Round 1

## Algorithm challenge

The first three tradable products are introduced: : `Rainforest Resin` , `Kelp`, and `Squid Ink`. The value of the `Rainforest Resin` has been stable throughout the history of the archipelago, the value of `Kelp` has been going up and down over time, and the value of `Squid Ink` can also swing a bit, but some say there is a pattern to be discovered in its prize progression. All algorithms uploaded in the tutorial round will be processed and generate results instantly, so you can experiment with different programs and strategies.

Position limits for the newly introduced products:

- `RAINFOREST_RESIN`: 50
- `KELP`: 50
- `SQUID_INK`: 50

### Hint

Squid Ink can be a very volatile product with price having large swings. Making a two-sided market or carrying position can be risky for such an instrument. However, with large swings comes large reversion. Squid Ink prices show more tendency to revert short term swings in price.

A metric to keep track of the size of deviation/swing from recent average could help in trading profitable positions.

## Manual challenge

You get the chance to do a series of trades in some foreign island currencies. The first trade is a conversion of your SeaShells into a foreign currency, the last trade is a conversion from a foreign currency into SeaShells. Everything in between is up to you. Give some thought to what series of trades you would like to do, as there might be an opportunity to walk away with more shells than you arrived with.
