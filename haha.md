# Round 1

## Algorithm Challenge

The first three tradable products are introduced: `Rainforest Resin`, `Kelp`, and `Squid Ink`.

- The value of **Rainforest Resin** has been stable throughout the history of the archipelago.
- The value of **Kelp** has been fluctuating over time.
- The value of **Squid Ink** can also swing, but some say there is a hidden pattern in its price progression.

All algorithms uploaded in the tutorial round will be processed and generate results instantly, so you can experiment with different programs and strategies.

### Position Limits
- `RAINFOREST_RESIN`: 50
- `KELP`: 50
- `SQUID_INK`: 50

### Hint

**Squid Ink** can be very volatile, with prices experiencing large swings. Making a two-sided market or holding large positions can be risky for such an instrument.

However, with large swings comes large reversion. Squid Ink prices tend to revert short-term swings.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
> A useful metric to track is the size of the deviation or swing from the recent average. This could help identify profitable trading opportunities.

## Manual Challenge

You will have the chance to perform a series of trades in foreign island currencies.

- The first trade will convert your **SeaShells** into a foreign currency.
- The last trade will convert the foreign currency back into **SeaShells**.
- Everything in between is up to you.

Give some thought to the trade sequence, as there may be an opportunity to walk away with more shells than you started with.
